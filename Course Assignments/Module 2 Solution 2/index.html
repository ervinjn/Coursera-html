<!-- Module 2 Assignment Solution 1
 In Solution 1, I positioned the section headings by floating them to the right, and then clearing the paragraph to the right.
In Solution 2, I positioned the section headings using aboslute positioning.  -->



<!-- One problem I really didn't solve was how to dynamically change the space between the section 
headers and text so that it looks good on a lot of different devices.   -->

  	<p  class="bigp midp smallp "> Modern Algebra is a branch of theoretical mathematics focused on the study of "algebraic structures".  An algebraic structure is a set with one or more binary operations defined on it.  Typically, the operations are assumed to satisfy certain properties, such as associativity, the existence of an identity element, and perhaps the existence of an inverse for every element.  
  	A class of algebraic structure that will be familiar to undergraduate students of engineering and mathematics is that an algebraic field (encountered in Linear Algebra).  These students will also have encountered a vector space, which involves the interplay between two algebraic structures: an abelian group (whose elements are thought of as "vectors") and a field of "scalars".

	<section class="col-md1-right inner" > <h1 id="head2" >  Group Theory  </h1>  
 		<p  class="bigp midp smallp ">  The simplest algebraic structure generally studied is a "group".  A group has a single, associative operation with an identity element, and for which every element has an inverse.  The group concept was developed in the 18th century by French mathematician Evariste Galois, who used them to settle a millennia-old question about the roots of polynomials. Since that time, they have found numerous applications as a theoretical tool throughout mathematics and the physical sciences.  The most fundamental goal of group theory itself is the classification of all groups.

	<section class="col-md2 outer-right" > <h1  id="head3">  Character Theory  </h1>  
 		<p  class="bigp midp smallp ">  The goal of classifying all groups was realized over the course of several decades for a special class of groups, the finite simple groups.  The definition of simple groups is beyond the scope of this short document. However, our goal here is to point out that the classification of the finite simple groups led to the developmen to yet another new field of mathematics, character theory.  In character theory, an abstract (finite) group is "reified" as a group of square matrices.  By taking the trace (sum of the diagonal) of each matrix, one obtains a real (or complex) function on the group.  The group's structure is then studied by studying it characters.  Both group theory and character theory are good illustrations of a strategy commonly employed in mathematics, whereby questions about a complex object are recast as questions about objects that are relatively less complex.
